            <p class="about_col">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting 
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text 
                ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
                and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
                 five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 
                 essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the 
                 release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
                 more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                 including versions of Lorem Ipsum.consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
                going through the cites of the word in classical 
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem
                Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de 
                Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
                by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
                on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
                The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            <h3>OUR HISTORY</h3>
            <p class="about_col">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem
                Ipsum is not simply random text. It
                has roots in a piece of classical Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
                years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professo
                r at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
                up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
                consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and 
                going through the cites of the word in classical 
                literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem

                comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below 
                for those
                interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
                 Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, 
                 accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
